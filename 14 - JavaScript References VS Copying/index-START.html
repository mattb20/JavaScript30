    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // will print 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // will print 200 100

    let name = 'Drake';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Drake Drake
    name = 'Future'
    console.log(name, name2); // Future Drake

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Max'; // Will change both players and team at index 3 to Max

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // will copy a whole array with no arguments passed
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // this is actually a reference and not a copy!
    captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person ,{ number: 99}); // fold in previous values and then one of our own
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
